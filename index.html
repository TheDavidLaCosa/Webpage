                Hi, thanks for coming in! I'm <strong>David Larrosa</strong> üòÅ
            </p>

            <p>
                This webpage contains the paper and poster that I presented at the 
                <strong>Catalan Congress of Artificial Intelligence (CCIA 27)</strong>.
                The article is called <em>‚ÄúHate Speech and Emojis: The journalist case‚Äù</em> but to make it short we‚Äôve also been calling it <strong>Disargue</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>Below you can read the following documents:</p>
            <ul class="intro-list">
                <li><strong>‚ÄúArticle Hate Speech and Emojis: The journalist case‚Äù (short version):</strong> This document is four pages long.</li>
                <li><strong>‚ÄúArticle Hate Speech and Emojis: The journalist case‚Äù (longer version):</strong> This document contains more insight into the original article.</li>
                <li><strong>CCIA Journal:</strong> This link brings you to the CCIA journal that contains all the other projects presented.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                This article is part of my final master thesis at the 
                <strong>Official University Master of Data Science (MUDS)</strong> at 
                <strong>La Salle ‚Äì Universitat Ramon Llull</strong>.

        <p class="thesis-text text-section">
            The use of social networks has become a common activity for most people. Although they offer many advantages, they also have the downside of enabling certain toxic behaviours that can be harmful to some individuals. Moderation of these behaviours has been the current solution applied on social networks. However, it has not been a particularly successful method because the current moderation process is partially manual, slow, and unable to keep up with the pace of content creation. All this has created the need to develop automatic methods for hate detection.  
            <br><br>
            This project has two main objectives: first, to analyze toxic behaviours to understand what they are and what characterizes them. The second goal is to develop a tool capable of detecting them automatically.  
            <br><br>
            This document shows how the study began with an analysis of what hate is and the state of the art in its detection. Then, it continues with a data analysis section, beginning with an introduction to what Natural Language Processing (NLP) is and its basic concepts, followed by an analysis of the data that will be used throughout the project. Next comes the more technical part, where Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and finally Large Language Models (LLM) methods are applied.  
            <br><br>
            In the ML section, models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost are used to classify the data. Then, in the DL section, various neural network architectures are presented, such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), combinations of MLP with fine-tuned BERT models, combinations of MLP with RNN, and finally, MLP with RNN with fine-tuned BERT models. In the LLM section, both hate detection specific models and general-purpose models are used to classify the data and compare their outputs with the original labels.  
            <br><br>
            The result of this project is a model capable of classifying text based on whether it contains hate or not, and an analysis of the different components of hate in the context of the 2024 European elections.  
            <br><br>
            This project is called <strong>Disargue</strong> and was carried out in collaboration with <strong>Blanquerna University</strong>.
